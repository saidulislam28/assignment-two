1. Explaining the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.

Primary Key ðŸ”‘
This is unique identifier of a table. 
Rules:
Must be unique
it's can't be null
Most of the time it's (id) column

For example:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);


Foreign Key ðŸ”—
Foreign key create relation between two tables. A foreign key is reference for table.
For Example:
   CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(55),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
  );

What it does:

Creates relationships between two tables
We can get the both table data with the foreign key
It's solve complexity problem in a table

Quick Example
sql-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Posts table (references users)
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
Now every post must belong to an existing user. We can't create a post without the existing user id.
Finally
Primary Key: Unique row identifier
Foreign Key: Table connector
Together they keep data clean and organized.

2. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

WHERE CLAUSE:
The WHERE clause is used to filters row in a table with condition and return the matched rows. It's tell the sql give me only those rows that meet my given condition.

Basic Filtering:

 SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE id = 10;

 It will only give me the row which is meet the condition.

Numeric Comparison:

 SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE price > 500;

 It will give the rows which price is bigger than 500.

Combining Conditions:

 SELECT FROM * TABLE_NAME WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 5000;

 It will show the rows who matched with the condition

Conclusion
 In conclusion, the WHERE clause plays a crucial role in SQL queries by allowing developers to filter records based on specific conditions. When used effectivelyâ€”such as filtering on indexed columns and sanitizing user inputs to prevent SQL injectionâ€”it not only improves query performance but also enhances data security and relevance.
